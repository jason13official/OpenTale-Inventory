# OpenTale Inventory System

A comprehensive, Minecraft-inspired inventory system built with the Bevy game engine in Rust. This system provides a flexible foundation for item management, container systems, and user interfaces in games.

## High-Level Overview

This system is designed around several key concepts that work together to create a robust item management experience:

1. **Items and Item Properties**: Define what items are and how they behave
2. **Item Stacks**: Group items together with quantity and merging logic
3. **Slots and Containers**: Store and organize item stacks in various arrangements
4. **Multiple Container Types**: Support different inventory types (player inventory, hotbar, chests)

This inventory system provides a solid foundation for any game requiring item management.

The use of Rust's type system ensures memory safety while Bevy's ECS architecture provides excellent performance and maintainability.
